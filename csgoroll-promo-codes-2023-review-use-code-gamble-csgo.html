<h2 id="element3">CSGORoll experiences</h2>
<p>Without question, CS:GO is probably the most innovative and advanced Counter-Strike of all time. At the same time, the game offers many options for those who want to make the regular appearance a little more colorful with modern and appealing skins. These can be bought directly on Steam – or they can be won in CS:GO casinos. One of these casinos is CSGORoll, where players can choose between several games in the portfolio. First you pay in your own skins, through which the stakes can then be placed. Whether the offer is serious, what needs to be considered and what our experience with the provider looks like, we will tell you in the following exactly.</p>

<h2 id="element4">Our experience at a glance with CSGORoll</h2>
<p>Anyone who has ever looked at a couple of different CS:GO casinos will be won over by the design and layout of CSGORoll at first glance. A great deal of work has been done here so that the visit can always be organized in an appealing setting. At the same time, the existing games are proven to be fair, which clearly underlines the quality of the provider. We were also able to award plus points in the CS:GO test for the integrated chat in which the players can talk. A small drawback, however, is possibly the fact that the conversations with the players can only be conducted in English or Russian. In any case, the German translation may still be missing a little. But if that doesn’t bother you, according to our experience, you will find an appealing and interesting portfolio here.</p>
<h2 id="element5">Is CSGORoll legit?</h2>
<p>Since your own skins, i.e. your own stake, have to be paid into the casino first, the seriousness should of course be examined carefully. The market is still quite young, but of course that doesn’t protect against criminal energy. According to our CS:GO experience, we cannot see any signs of fraud or rip-off with this provider.</p>
<p>The entire appearance makes a serious impression, and the provider is one of the largest and best-known representatives of its kind. It is hardly surprising that the games in the portfolio also leave no room for doubt as to their correctness. This is ensured by the Provably Fair method, through which the decisions within the games are always made according to mathematical calculations. In plain language: A CSGORoll fraud by the provider or other players can be ruled out without further concerns.</p>
<h2 id="element6">The offer at a glance</h2>
<p>First of all, the most important aspect after logging in via Steam is topping up your own account in the casino. For this purpose, the existing CS:GO skins are used, which are “bought” by the provider with his game currency. If the appropriate skins have been selected, the casino makes an offer that the players can then accept. Once the exchange is completed, the chips are in the player’s account and the skins are in the hands of the casino.</p>
<p>You can then use the three different games on offer to increase your credit and get better skins. The game roulette can be found directly in the lobby on the home page, in which players have to bet on colors or numbers. If you opt for the red numbers from one to seven, you will receive twice the stake if you win. It is the same with bets on the black numbers from eight to 14. Only the zero is an exception, as in this case 14 times the bet is paid out to the players. In addition to roulette, the game Crash can also be played. With this title, the players have to decide on a price development or determine when the price drops. The higher the approach, the more risk there is – and the higher the profit. The selection in the repertoire is rounded off by the game of dice, in which the total number of points thrown must be used.</p>
<h2 id="element7">Deposit: Immediate transfer of the skins</h2>
<p>The successful deposit into the player account is the basic requirement for participation in the games in the portfolio. The deposit is carried out by clicking on the “Deposit” button, which is located in the upper area of ​​the website. Once that’s done, customers see a full inventory of their skins and can now easily choose which of them they would like to give to the casino. Once all skins have been selected and the transaction has been carried out, the respective coins for the games are immediately posted to the account. The players can start playing the games immediately, but of course the skins have also disappeared from the inventory immediately.</p>
<h2 id="element8">Security and Regulation: Fair Games and Impressive Size</h2>
<p>As our CSGORoll experiences show, this casino is by no means a “little fish”. Rather, the CSGORoll has been extremely successful in the young industry for several years and is one of the best-known addresses on the market. This can be seen, for example, from the fact that almost 1,000 players are regularly active at the same time and take advantage of the offer.</p>
<p>If this were not a reputable provider, such a large audience would of course be unthinkable. At the same time, the casino provides another reason to be happy, because the games in the portfolio are all proven to be fair. This means that there is no CSGORoll fraud to be feared, as all decisions are always made through correct mathematical calculations. The bottom line is that this is the greatest evidence that CSGORoll works seriously and honorably.</p>
<h2 id="element9">Support and customer service: The problems can all be solved</h2>
<p>Should problems or misunderstandings arise, the players should go to the support area of ​​the casino. First of all, the provider’s FAQs can be found here, in which he answers the most frequently asked questions of all players. That is a very pleasant aspect, although the questions and answers are only written in English. In addition, according to our CSGORoll experience, a message can also be sent to customer support, which can be sent by email. After a certain waiting time, an English answer will be sent, although in both cases even a little knowledge of English is sufficient for understanding.</p>
<h2 id="element10">Ease of use: Problem-free control through the offer</h2>
<p>We already discussed the optical advantages of the casino at the beginning of the review. At the same time, the provider also scores with a certain user-friendliness, which is due to the structured structure of the homepage. The most important areas and menus, for example, can all be found at the top of the screen. In addition, there are also small icons for deposit or customer support that are permanently attached to the picture and are therefore always available. There shouldn’t be any problems with the controls. Not even if a player has not yet had any experience in a CS:GO casino.</p>
<h2 id="element11">Conclusion: playing is fun here</h2>
<p>The casino was able to show itself from a good side in our CSGORoll test and does not allow any thoughts of fraud or rip-off. Instead, a whole lot of fun is offered here permanently, even if the selection in the portfolio could be a little bit more varied. Really real points of criticism cannot be found. Instead, the Provably Fair procedure underlines that the CSGORoll works seriously. Customers are always in the best of hands here and can be aware of the correctness of every single round of the game.</p>

At the same time, the game offers many options for those who want to make the regular appearance a little more colorful with modern and appealing skins. These can be bought directly on Steam – or they can be won in CS:GO casinos. One of these casinos is CSGORoll, where players can choose between several games in the portfolio. First you pay in your own skins, through which the stakes can then be placed.

A great deal of work has been done here so that the visit can always be organized in an appealing setting. At the same time, the existing games are proven to be fair, which clearly underlines the quality of the provider. We were also able to award plus points in the CS:GO test for the integrated chat in which the players can talk. A small drawback, however, is possibly the fact that the conversations with the players can only be conducted in English or Russian. In any case, the German translation may still be missing a little. But if that doesn’t bother you, according to our experience, you will find an appealing and interesting portfolio here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"element5\"\u003eIs CSGORoll legit?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince your own skins, i.e. your own stake, have to be paid into the casino first, the seriousness should of course be examined carefully. The market is still quite young, but of course that doesn’t protect against criminal energy. According to our CS:GO experience, we cannot see any signs of fraud or rip-off with this provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire appearance makes a serious impression, and the provider is one of the largest and best-known representatives of its kind. It is hardly surprising that the games in the portfolio also leave no room for doubt as to their correctness. This is ensured by the Provably Fair method, through which the decisions within the games are always made according to mathematical calculations. In plain language: A CSGORoll fraud by the provider or other players can be ruled out without further concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"element6\"\u003eThe offer at a glance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, the most important aspect after logging in via Steam is topping up your own account in the casino. For this purpose, the existing CS:GO skins are used, which are “bought” by the provider with his game currency. If the appropriate skins have been selected, the casino makes an offer that the players can then accept. Once the exchange is completed, the chips are in the player’s account and the skins are in the hands of the casino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can then use the three different games on offer to increase your credit and get better skins. The game roulette can be found directly in the lobby on the home page, in which players have to bet on colors or numbers. If you opt for the red numbers from one to seven, you will receive twice the stake if you win. It is the same with bets on the black numbers from eight to 14. Only the zero is an exception, as in this case 14 times the bet is paid out to the players. In addition to roulette, the game Crash can also be played. With this title, the players have to decide on a price development or determine when the price drops. The higher the approach, the more risk there is – and the higher the profit. The selection in the repertoire is rounded off by the game of dice, in which the total number of points thrown must be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"element7\"\u003eDeposit: Immediate transfer of the skins\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe successful deposit into the player account is the basic requirement for participation in the games in the portfolio. The deposit is carried out by clicking on the “Deposit” button, which is located in the upper area of ​​the website. Once that’s done, customers see a full inventory of their skins and can now easily choose which of them they would like to give to the casino. Once all skins have been selected and the transaction has been carried out, the respective coins for the games are immediately posted to the account. The players can start playing the games immediately, but of course the skins have also disappeared from the inventory immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"element8\"\u003eSecurity and Regulation: Fair Games and Impressive Size\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs our CSGORoll experiences show, this casino is by no means a “little fish”. Rather, the CSGORoll has been extremely successful in the young industry for several years and is one of the best-known addresses on the market. This can be seen, for example, from the fact that almost 1,000 players are regularly active at the same time and take advantage of the offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this were not a reputable provider, such a large audience would of course be unthinkable. At the same time, the casino provides another reason to be happy, because the games in the portfolio are all proven to be fair. This means that there is no CSGORoll fraud to be feared, as all decisions are always made through correct mathematical calculations. The bottom line is that this is the greatest evidence that CSGORoll works seriously and honorably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"element9\"\u003eSupport and customer service: The problems can all be solved\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould problems or misunderstandings arise, the players should go to the support area of ​​the casino. First of all, the provider’s FAQs can be found here, in which he answers the most frequently asked questions of all players. That is a very pleasant aspect, although the questions and answers are only written in English.
