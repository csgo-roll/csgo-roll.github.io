   Although CSGORoll is a trade-friendly website, it doesn't convert that to design very well, but it's time to change. The community has been offering suggestions up close, so we thought, why not give them the power to design the way they want?

   This will be a UI/UX Framework Design competition for the withdrawal page. Do you think you can solve this? For this challenge, you will have to explore your creativity and problem solving skills and here is a list of what we want to achieve with this competition:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    Clear withdraw interface for new customers;
   </li>
<li>
    Improved filters for item selection, such as; Type, Exterior, Stickers, and Mark-up %;
   </li>
<li>
    Improved order-by functionality, such as; float value, and lowest mark-up;
   </li>
<li>
    A better user experience for the players and traders where they have full control over what they select for the marketplace.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>

    Click here for more details about the filters
   
   . The real challenge is to come up with the best functional marketplace flow you can think of, allowing the customer to sort their items without making it too complex. This way, you don't have to worry about styling the design and can focus on problem-solving.
