Clients can purchase, sell and exchange skins at <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/veQcoHYi\" target=\"_blank\">swap.gg</a> effectively and securely. Starting around 2017 <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/veQcoHYi\" target=\"_blank\">swap.gg</a> has accumulated 1,181,358 or more clients and finished over 8,3 million effective exchanges.\n </p>\n<p>\n  As you can see by the timeframe they have been directing business, their web-based media movement, the quantity of clients they have and the effective exchanges they have finished they are a totally genuine CS:GO skin exchanging website.\n </p>\n<h2>\n  The Release\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The website was registered a year and a half ago, on March 2016. Currently, the website is approaching this mark. The analytics was collected using Whois and SimilarWeb web tools.\n </p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"swap.gg code\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/hzuFq06T.jpeg\" width=\"1000\">\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Audience\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The primary audience of the website comes from the Russian Federation, amounting to 23.81% of total visitors. Second and third places are occupied by Ukraine and Slovakia.\n </p>\n<p>\n  Top 5 countries:\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Russian Federation – 23.81%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Ukraine – 15.92%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Slovakia – 3.66%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   United States – 3.43%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Jersey – 3.16%\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"swap gg audience\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1345px) 100vw, 1345px\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/pOXJh6RK.png\" width=\"1345\">\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Pricing\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The pricing system can appear confusing at first sight, so we decided to provide you with a more detailed description. At the bottom of the website, between your inventory on the left and available skins on the right you can see a table with Market Rates. Let’s take a closer look:\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Key 96% – 101%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Knife 98% – 103%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Rare Weapons 95% – 100%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Weapons 90% – 95%\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Misc 85% – 90%\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The first value nominates the difference in price with Steam Market if you are trading your skin to the bot, and the second one if you are buying the skin from the bot. Here’s an example: if you want to sell a skin, which costs $100, to the service you will receive 0.96*$100 =$96 for your item. If you want to buy the same $100 skin from the bot, you will pay 1.01*$100 =$101 for it. As you can see, the rates are quite reasonable.\n </p>\n<h2>\n  Withdrawal Methods\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The website doesn’t allow you to trade your skins for real money, so there are no withdrawal methods.\n </p>\n<h2>\n  Commission\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The only commission rates imposed by the service are those you can see in the Market Rates section.\n </p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"swap.gg legit\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/jSv7zCNh.jpeg\" width=\"1000\">\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Tech Support\n </h2>\n<p>\n  We didn’t manage to find any online support or the way to chat with support directly. You can either write about your problem at the service’s Steam community or DM them on Twitter, but there’s no directly stated support contact information.\n </p>\n<h2>\n  Why Do We Trust This Website?\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The main argument for trading on this website is the fact that you are selling your in-game items to a bot, not real people. This guarantees the speed and safety of the transaction. Moreover, if you see that the elements participating in the trade on the website and on Steam are different, simply decline the trade offer. However, we didn’t manage to find reviews of the website on such platforms as TrustPilot or a review section at their website.\n </p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"swap gg trustpilot\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/iw2QYWRi.png\" width=\"660\">\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Bonuses and Promotions\n </h2>\n<p>\n  The website doesn’t offer membership and discount programs.

The website is divided into four fields – Your Offer, Inventory, Bot Offer and Bot Inventory. They are separated by two information blocks – Bot Filter, Market Rates – and two buttons.\n </p>\n<p>\n  After you have signed in with your Steam account and entered your trade URL, available skins will appear at the bottom-left corner, in your inventory. If you don’t see some of the items in your inventory, then try to refresh it or wait. The service warns that only items purchased more than seven days ago will be visible.\n </p>\n<p>\n  Moreover, some of your skins may be labeled as “Overstock,” which means the bot has a surplus of them, and your items won’t be accepted. But, don’t get upset – the fluctuations of skins are incredibly quick, which means several days later they will be in demand.\n </p>\n<h2>\n  How to Trade on <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/veQcoHYi\" target=\"_blank\">swap.gg</a>?\n </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   1️⃣ Sign in through Steam, set up your trade URL.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   2️⃣ Select the items you want to swap from your inventory at the bottom left corner of the page.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   3️⃣ Find the skin you want to buy, or click “Auto Select” for the bot to choose skins of corresponding value.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   4️⃣ Click “Trade” and wait for 10 to 15 seconds for the exchange to proceed.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  Pros and Cons of Using This Service\n </h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid black; color: black;\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n<b>\n      Pros\n     </b>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n<b>\n      Cons\n     </b>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n     ✅ Convenient bot filter\n    </td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n     ❌ No Online support\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n     ✅ Immediate skins exchange\n    </td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n     ❌ No reviews page\n    </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n     ✅ Simple interface\n    </td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid; text-align: center;\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>\n  SWAPP.gg Overview\n </h2>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/veQcoHYi\" target=\"_blank\">swap.gg</a> was established in 2017 and is a site for\n  \n   exchanging CS:GO skins\n  \n  just as virtual things for Z1 Battle Royal, Rust, DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2.
