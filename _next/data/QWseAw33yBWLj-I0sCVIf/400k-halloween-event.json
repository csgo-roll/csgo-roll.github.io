She'll be handing out 100,000 Coins on Friday 8th October, Friday 15th October, Friday 22nd October and Sunday 31st October, split between ten lucky winners. Could you be one of them?\n  </p>\n<p>\n   We'll count your candy earnings until 6pm UTC on the day of the event. Following this, the leaderboard will reset for the next week ahead.\n  </p>\n<p>\n   The coins will be paid out to our winners during a livestream at 6pm UTC on the day of the event. Here's what's up for grabs;\n  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    1st Place - 50,000 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    2nd Place - 20,000 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    3rd place - 10,000 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    4th place - 7,000 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    5th place - 4,000 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    6th place - 3,000 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    7th place - 2,250 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    8th place - 1,750 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    9th place - 1,250 coins\n   </li>\n<li>\n    10th place - 750 coins\n   </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n   This Halloween, sharing isn't caring. Unlike our previous events, there's no teams; it's a free-for-all battle where it's up to you alone to hit the top spot. But if you draw with another user, the prize\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be split. To avoid having to share your chunk of the prize, you better fight for it...\n  </p>\n<h3 id=\"tasty-treats-from-the-red-witch\">\n   Tasty Treats from The Red Witch\n  </h3>\n<p>\n   The Red Witch is collecting candy to test her new Skins recipes.
