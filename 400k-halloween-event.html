    Are you ready for another spooktacular promotion? From weekly competitions to in-game events, here's what we've got planned for you this Halloween.

</p>

<h3 id="100k-weekly-competition">
   100k Weekly Competition
  </h3>
<p>
   Each week, our Witch, 'Red', will reward the top ten candy collectors on the Cauldron Leaderboard with extra special prizes. She'll be handing out 100,000 Coins on Friday 8th October, Friday 15th October, Friday 22nd October and Sunday 31st October, split between ten lucky winners. Could you be one of them?
  </p>
<p>
   We'll count your candy earnings until 6pm UTC on the day of the event. Following this, the leaderboard will reset for the next week ahead.
  </p>
<p>
   The coins will be paid out to our winners during a livestream at 6pm UTC on the day of the event. Here's what's up for grabs;
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    1st Place - 50,000 coins
   </li>
<li>
    2nd Place - 20,000 coins
   </li>
<li>
    3rd place - 10,000 coins
   </li>
<li>
    4th place - 7,000 coins
   </li>
<li>
    5th place - 4,000 coins
   </li>
<li>
    6th place - 3,000 coins
   </li>
<li>
    7th place - 2,250 coins
   </li>
<li>
    8th place - 1,750 coins
   </li>
<li>
    9th place - 1,250 coins
   </li>
<li>
    10th place - 750 coins
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   This Halloween, sharing isn't caring. Unlike our previous events, there's no teams; it's a free-for-all battle where it's up to you alone to hit the top spot. But if you draw with another user, the prize
   <em>
    will
   </em>
   be split. To avoid having to share your chunk of the prize, you better fight for it...

   Tasty Treats from The Red Witch

<p>
   The Red Witch is collecting candy to test her new Skins recipes. In exchange, she'll reward you with some eerily fantastic cases.
