<p>
   All of us at CSGORoll want to say a huge thank you for being part of the amazing community we've built together. Our incredible events are only possible because of your constant support and willingness to follow our journey.
  </p>
<p>
   As we plan on being here for many years to come, we always listen to the problems you face on our site. And though a reported lag in performance and small improvements have been pending due to our priorities, we've now made it our absolute mission to solve them.
  </p>
<p>
   We're dedicating time and resources to improving the performance of CSGORoll to make sure that your experience continues to be positive and flawless. We're even allocating some of the resources that would be used for other events, including our anniversary and Easter, for something bigger.
  </p>
<p>
   You may have noticed improvements over the past weeks, but there's still more to come. And as promised, once the site performance is fully improved we'll host a HUGE giveaway to celebrate!
