   Put on your sunscreen, prepare the duck float and let's see what is waiting for you during this CSGORoll summer event. From June 20th to August 1st, you get to enjoy everything we prepared for you.

   Themed design
  </h3>
<p>
   The first thing you will notice is that to get you in the summer mood, we have changed the website design to make it fun and themed. Make sure to wear sunglasses for the full immersion!

   Beach Balls
  </h3>
<p>
   Collect beach balls by playing any of the games available on CSGORoll and spend them on special cases at the lifeguard post.

<h3 id="team-selection">
   Team Selection
  </h3>
<p>
   You and your team will have to fight to collect as many beach balls as possible to secure a good position for the main prize. Your team's position will define which of the top 3 prizes you will compete for, so it's best to help them reach the main prize or they will bury you in the sand.

   We also have a special reward for those who fight for their team. Starting on July 4th, the MVP of each team will be rewarded with an extra 5000 coins!
